Wheter we can then say that the conflcit trap is thus the most important factor for conflict is another matter altogether and I would definitely not be so bold (indeed, the conflcit trap is in it self a product of a lot of other features).

After the temporal patterns of conflict the spacial patterns might constitute the most informative potential - so why have we not created any such features (disregarding the crude country wide measures)? Indeed geopandas is able to generate at lot of interesting features here such as distance to other conflicts etc. The reason we did not create such features, doing our feature egeneering effort, is that it takes a very long time. And if we want to take advantage of multiporcessing we have to implement it ourself (last I checked, at least). This is not that hard, but it is a bit beside the point in this course so I leave for the curious to explore another time. \n",
